n = number of images
a = presentation time for one image
b = duration for cross-fading

animation-duration = t = (a + b) * n

animation-delay = t/n or a + b

No matter how many images you are using, you will always have 5 keyframes in your fade animation:
0%
a/t * 100%
(a + b) / t * 100% = 1/n * 100%
100% - (b/t * 100%)
100%
